## Issues

---

### From local server

Sometimes you might change the CSS file but the changes could not appear [clear cache](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52682812/django-css-not-updating)

### From the server side on pythonanywhere

Sometimes our blog could not create a post because on the database there is not table to store it, some solution to run on the server side are:
